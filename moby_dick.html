    <p>
        The <a href="https://www.softcover.io/">Softcover</a> publishing platform was designed mainly for
        ebooks like the <a href="https://railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> book</a> and 
        <a href="https://learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a>,
        but it's also good for making more traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman
        Melville (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>). We present below a short and affectionately irrelevant book report
        on this classic of American literature.

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago-never mind how long precisely-having little or no money in my purse,
            and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the
            world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleeen and regulating the circulation.
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be good for you), Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one
        jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who— <em>spoiler alert!</em>—is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
